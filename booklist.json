          "description": "Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world’s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they’re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You’ll learn how to: –Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization –Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing –Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs –Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy –Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, \"Security Engineering Cheat Sheets\" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you’re most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.",

You’ll learn how to gain maximum value from Domain-Driven Design (DDD), define optimal supporting architecture, and succeed with modern UX-first design approaches. The author guides you through choosing and implementing specific technologies and addresses key user-experience topics, including mobile-friendly and responsive design. You’ll learn how to gain more value from existing Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET MVC and SignalR by using them alongside other technologies such as Bootstrap, AJAX, JSON, and JQuery. By using these techniques and understanding the new ASP.NET Core 1.0, you can quickly build advanced web solutions that solve today’s problems and deliver an outstanding user experience. Microsoft MVP Dino Esposito shows you how to: Plan websites and web apps to mirror real-world social and business processes Use DDD to dissect and master the complexity of business domains Use UX-Driven Design to reduce costs and give customers what they want Realistically compare server-side and client-side web paradigms Get started with the new ASP.NET Core 1.0 Simplify modern visual webpage construction with Bootstrap Master practical, efficient techniques for running ASP.NET MVC projects Consider new options for implementing persistence and working with data models Understand Responsive Web Design’s pros, cons, and tradeoffs Build truly mobile-friendly, mobile-optimized websites About This Book For experienced developers and solution architects who want to plan and develop web solutions more effectively Assumes basic familiarity with the Microsoft web development stack",

This comprehensive book explores the latest challenges in web application security, providing you with an in-depth understanding of hackers' methods and the practical knowledge and skills needed to effectively understand web attacks. The book starts by emphasizing the importance of mindset and toolset in conducting successful web attacks. You’ll then explore the methodologies and frameworks used in these attacks, and learn how to configure the environment using interception proxies, automate tasks with Bash and Python, and set up a research lab. As you advance through the book, you’ll discover how to attack the SAML authentication layer; attack front-facing web applications by learning WordPress and SQL injection, and exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices, such as command injection, by going through three CTFs and learning about the discovery of seven CVEs. Each chapter analyzes confirmed cases of exploitation mapped with MITRE ATT&CK. You’ll also analyze attacks on Electron JavaScript-based applications, such as XSS and RCE, and the security challenges of auditing and exploiting Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. Finally, you’ll find out how to disclose vulnerabilities. By the end of this book, you’ll have enhanced your ability to find and exploit web vulnerabilities.What you will learn Understand the mindset, methodologies, and toolset needed to carry out web attacks Discover how SAML and SSO work and study their vulnerabilities Get to grips with WordPress and learn how to exploit SQL injection Find out how IoT devices work and exploit command injection Familiarize yourself with ElectronJS applications and transform an XSS to an RCE Discover how to audit Solidity’s Ethereum smart contracts Get the hang of decompiling, debugging, and instrumenting web applications Who this book is for This book is for anyone whose job role involves ensuring their organization's security – penetration testers and red teamers who want to deepen their knowledge of the current security challenges for web applications, developers and DevOps professionals who want to get into the mindset of an attacker; and security managers and CISOs looking to truly understand the impact and risk of web, IoT, and smart contracts.
